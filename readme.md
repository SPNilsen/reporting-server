# Description
Implementation of basic Reporting Server functionality
Supply date range on post to retrieve a PDF that uses that date range.
Built on reportjs and handlebars.

# WARNING
Due to all of the file changes the reporting server makes on startup, you can't use nodemon with this as-is. Needs more investigation on how to ignore the changes.
